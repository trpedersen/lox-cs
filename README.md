## lox-cs

This is a C# .Net Core port of the Lox compiler that Bob Nystrom is (gradually) putting together on his site https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/

It has a fair bit to go in terms of wrapping up a presentation layer, and I'm only up to interpreting basic expressions. Check out the test code for details.

I'll update the project some more once Bob has fully written the sections to do with stack-based compilers.
